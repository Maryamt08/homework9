Readme Generator

This is a command-line application that runs with Node.js that generates a README.md file based on input about your project. The user is prompted for their name, the project title, a description of the project, installations, the use is of the application, contributions, and how to test the application. Then the answers populate a README generated for the users project so that the user can spend more time working on finishing their project and less time on the read me.
